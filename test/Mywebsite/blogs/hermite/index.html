        Charles Hermite was a great French mathematician who researched the field of number theory, <br>
        quadratic forms, invariant theory, orthogonal polynomials, algebra, and elliptic functions. Some <br>
        of his works are named after him to honor him like Hermite polynomials, Hermite interpolation, <br>
        Hermite Normal form, Hermitian operators, and cubic Hermite splines. He was born in Dieuze, <br>
        Moselle, on 24 December 1822, with a deformity in his right foot that would impair his gait <br>
        throughout his life.He read some of Joseph-Louis Lagrange’s writings on the solution of <br>
        numerical equations and Carl Friedrich Gauss’s publications on number theory.<br>

        Hermite Wanted to study at Ecole Polytechnique a very renowned for excellence in mathematics, <br>
        science, and engineering. In 1845 he was admitted to the school but after a year he was not allowed <br>
        to study because of his deformed foot and he quit the Ecole Polytechnique without graduating. <br>

        Hermite spent his five years working privately toward his degree and he met friends, eminent <br>
        mathematician Joseph Bertrand, Carl Gustav Jacob, Jacobi, and Joseph Liouville, he took and<br>
         passed the examinations for the Baccalaureat, which he was awarded in 1847.<br>

        In July 1848, he was elected to the French Academy of sciences. In1869, he succeeded <br>
        Jean-Marie Duhamel as professor of mathematics, both at the Ecole Polytechnique. Upon his <br>
        70th birthday, he was promoted to grand officer in the french legion of Honour. He died in Paris <br>
        on 14 January 1901, aged 78.<br>

        I have already had some experience with the beziers curve, as I am  <br>
        interested to solve computational problems using mathematics, the
        work done by Hermite is very helpful, for example, his research regarding number theory, orthogonal polynomials, invariant theory, and
        others. I will sure be implementing his work in my projects and competition. Also, I realized that
        Charles Hermite and Nikola tesla died on the same day coincident?
